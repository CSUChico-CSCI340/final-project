# CSCI551 Inquiry Based Group Project

## Goals
This project has the following goals:

* Students work in a team
* Project sets out to answer a question about a topic related to numerical methods or parallel programming. 
* Students find a survey of research work as the starting point of their project
* Students devise a way to test and/or gain understanding about the question they are trying to ask through a hands on implementation of the concept.
	* Should come up with a procedure or method for testing the effectiveness of known solutions or their solutions.
* Students present their findings to the class
* Students write up a document with their findings


## Example
An example might be:

* How does the performance of a modern parallel programming language, like [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/) or [UPC](https://upc.lbl.gov/) compare to solving the same problem in C++ w/ OpenMPI?


## Evaluation

Your project will be graded based on the following components.

* Proposal - You need to submit a proposal with the following:
	* Question or topic you want to know more about
	* How you will answer the question/test your understanding
* Papers - You will need to find a minimum of 4 papers that relate to your topic or try to solve the question you are wanting to answer. These cannot all come from the same research group/team.
* Presentation - You will need to give a short 5-10 minute presentation to the class on what you were trying to answer, how you tested, and what findings you discovered
* Periodic Check in - I will meet with your group part way through to determine if you are making adequate progress on your project.
* Paper - You will submit a short paper describing what you were trying to answer, how you tested it, the testing results, and what you learned from these results.
